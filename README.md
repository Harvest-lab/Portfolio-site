# My Process
1. Planning & Structure
First, I mapped out what my portfolio needed to communicate:
Who I am,
What I do,
The services I offer,
My recent projects,
How visitors can contact me.
I planned these sections to match the key goals of a portfolio: clarity, professionalism, and conversion (getting clients).

2. Design & Layout
I chose a clean, responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile.
I made sure:
The hero “Hi, it’s Harvest” immediately tells visitors who I am,
The services and work sections are easy to scan,
Testimonials add trust from real clients.

3. Building the Website
I built the website using:
HTML to structure the content,
CSS to style the site and make it responsive,
And JavaScript for interactive parts.
I focused on mobile-first design so it looks great on phones and desktops — since many visitors browse on mobile.

4. Content Creation
I wrote clear, professional text for:
My “About Me” section,
Service descriptions,
Project previews,
Testimonials from clients.
This makes it easy for visitors to understand my skills and what I can help them with.

5. Deployment
Once complete:
I hosted the site on Netlify,
Connected it to my GitHub repo,
Ensured the live link is accessible and fast.
