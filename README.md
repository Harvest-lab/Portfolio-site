# My Process
1. Planning & Structure
First, I mapped out what my portfolio needed to communicate:
i. Who I am,
ii. What I do,
iii. The services I offer,
iv. My recent projects,
v. How visitors can contact me.
I planned these sections to match the key goals of a portfolio: clarity, professionalism, and conversion (getting clients).

2. Design & Layout
I chose a clean, responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile.
I made sure:
i. The hero “Hi, it’s Harvest” immediately tells visitors who I am,
ii. The services and work sections are easy to scan,
iii. Testimonials add trust from real clients.

3. Building the Website
i. I built the website using:
ii. HTML to structure the content,
iii. CSS to style the site and make it responsive,
iv. And JavaScript for interactive parts.
v. I focused on mobile-first design so it looks great on phones and desktops — since many visitors browse on mobile.

4. Content Creation
i. I wrote clear, professional text for:
ii. My “About Me” section,
iii. Service descriptions,
iv. Project previews,
v. Testimonials from clients.
This makes it easy for visitors to understand my skills and what I can help them with.

5. Deployment
Once complete:
I hosted the site on Netlify,
Connected it to my GitHub repo,
Ensured the live link is accessible and fast.
